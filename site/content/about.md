### About

Pearmo establishes peer-to-peer communication via WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) with Firebase servers for signaling.

### Data & Privacy

Connection information is temporarily stored on Pearmo's servers to establish and manage peer connections between participants. This information is deleted when participants end the call.

Message and media stream contents are transferred through the peer connections and do not pass through Pearmo's servers.

Pearmo uses Umami for website analytics and Google Adsense for advertising.
